# ExpressionParser

Parser and tree representation for arithmetic expressions

This program uses a recursive tree representation for arithmetic expressions (Composite Pattern). It reads such expressions from input and parses them just like a compiler for a programming language. The parser operates by recursive descent.

Once stored in the tree representation, expressions can be evaluated or printed out in prefix, infix and postfix forms.
